## 3. INGESTBASE: A Declarative Data Ingestion System, Arxiv, Jan, 2017
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.06093v1.pdf)

Declarative language to do ingestion logic on data and preprocessing, as data is ingested in the system. 


## 2. AdaptDB: Adaptive Partitioning for Distributed Joins by Samuel Madden, VLDB 2017
[Paper](http://jindal-web.appspot.com/papers/p589-lu.pdf)

Partitioning datasets across a cluster and incrementally refining data partitioning as queries are run. AdaptDB introduces a novel hyper-join that avoids expensive data shuffling by identifying storage blocks of the joining tables that overlap on the join attribute, and only joining those blocks. Hyper-join performs well when each block in one table overlaps with few blocks in the other table, since that will minimize the number of blocks that have to be accessed.

## 1. Snorkel: Dark Data and Machine Learning: by Christopher RÃ© VLDB 2017

- Deploying ML still require a PhD.
  - User struggle to write good feature.
  - Production of dataset is very difficult
  - Label all the training data.
  - Training Data is the New New OIL.
- Goal of Project: Create training data heuristically.
  - Past: Create structured data from unstructured text data. Takes a lot of time to do this.
