## Winograd Schema Challenge
- [WebPage](https://cs.nyu.edu/faculty/davise/papers/WinogradSchemas/WS.html)

A Winograd schema is a pair of sentences that differ in only one or two words and that contain an ambiguity that is resolved in opposite ways in the two sentences and requires the use of world knowledge and reasoning for its resolution. The schema takes its name from a well-known example by Terry Winograd
- The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they [feared/advocated] violence.
If the word is ''feared'', then ''they'' presumably refers to the city council; if it is ''advocated'' then ''they'' presumably refers to the demonstrators.

## Systematic search strategies
- **Terminologies**:
  - Goal, Goal formulation, Problem formulation, env. is determinisitic.
  - Problem Formulation: What actions and states to consider, given a goal.
  - We assume the environment is observable, so agent knows the current state.
  - We assume the environment is deterministric, so every actions has one output.
- **Search**:
  - Process of looking at a sequence of actions that reaches the goal.
  - Solution: Sequence of Actions. Sometimes the solution is to find the final goal state, like in N-Queens Problem.
- **Well defined problems and solutions**
  - Problem Component
    - Initial state
    - Possible actions
    - Transition model: output state after applying action.
    - Goal test
    - Path cost
