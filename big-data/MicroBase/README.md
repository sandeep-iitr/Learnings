# Paper in SIGMOD 2017

## Novelties
- A new reservoir sampler and Heavy-hitters sketch specialized for fast data
- Maximize the utility of each result being shown.
- A search engine to help identify the most relevant data and trends.

## Today
- A range of scalable analysis pipelines can be developed to compute over fast data
- However, the actual implementation is upto application developer.
- Requirements: 
  - Determine few results to return to user
  - Executing quickly to keep up with immense data volumes.
  - Adapting to changes within the data stream itself
  
 - Challenge:
   - Require expertise in domain, statistics, ML and data flow processing.
   - Such a combination is rare.
